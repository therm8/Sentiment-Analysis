Sentiment analysis of tweets about fantasy premier league

Project where I aimed to make a sentiment analysis of tweets about Fantasy Premier League. The tweets were scraped from twitter 
using a the script GetOldTweets3 by github user Mottl (https://github.com/Mottl/GetOldTweets3). A million tweets were scraped in
total. Before making predictions of the tweets the algorithms were trained using the VADER dataset by by Hutto and Gilbert (2014).
